# gsi_sim

The command line program `gsi_sim` is designed to do two separate tasks:
  1. Infer the population of origin and the mixing proportions of organisms
(typically fish like salmon) sampled from a mixed collection, whilst jointly
estimating the mixing proportions.  This is known in fisheries as 
"Genetic Stock Identification" or GSI
  2. Conduct simulations of such inference to predict the power of the genetic
markers assembled in a "genetic basline" to conduct.  

`gsi_sim` was originally written to do #2 above, but 
later was adopted to do  #1 as well.  

To make it you should be able to do:
```
./configure
make
```
For abbreviated information on the available options do
```
gsi_sim --help
```
and for compete information, try
```
gsi_sim --help-full
```
